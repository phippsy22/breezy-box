# Breezy Box: Wall-Mounted Air Purifier for A1 Mini+ 

Breathe easy with Breezy Box, a compact and efficient DIY air purifier designed for wall-mounted convenience. This project is perfect for anyone looking to improve their indoor air quality, and it's optimized for 3D printing on A1 Mini.

**Features:**

* **Wall-Mounted Design:** Frees up valuable floor space and blends seamlessly into your home environment.
* **A1 Mini Compatible:** Optimized for printing on the Bambu Lab A1 Mini (128 x 128 x 128 mm build volume), but printable on larger printers too.
* **Efficient Filtration:** Accommodates two 120mm PC fans for powerful air circulation and filtration (fans not included).
* **Easy Assembly:** Simple construction with clear instructions and minimal hardware.

**Materials:**

* 1.5 kg PLA filament
* 16 x M5 16mm screws
* 12 x M3 8mm screws
* 2 x 120mm PC fans (not included)
* 12V 3A power supply
* 12V to 5V USB step-down converter
* ESP32-WROOM-32 board
* 1x Ikea FÃ–RNUFTIG air filter
* Optional: Addressable LED strip (WS2812B or similar)
* Optional: 1 to 5 PWM fan hub

**Print Settings:**

* 8% adaptive cubic infill
* 5 bottom and top layers
* 2 walls

**Electronics:**

* The ESP32 controls the fan speed via PWM and can optionally control an addressable LED strip.
* A 12V to 3.3V buck converter powers the ESP32 from the 12V power supply.
* A 12V to 5V USB step-down converter powers the optional LED strip.
